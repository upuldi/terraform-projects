# ✅ NACL Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Objective Achieved**
Private subnets now only accept traffic from public subnets, implementing **defense-in-depth** security.

## 🔧 **What Was Added**

### 1. **Public Subnet NACL** (`aws_network_acl.public`)
- **Policy**: Allow all traffic (standard public subnet behavior)
- **Subnets**: All public subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)

### 2. **Private Subnet NACL** (`aws_network_acl.private`) ⭐ **RESTRICTIVE**
- **Policy**: Only allow traffic from public subnets + essential services
- **Subnets**: All private subnets (10.0.101.0/24, 10.0.102.0/24)

### 3. **NACL Rules Added** (26 total rules)
```
INBOUND (5 rule types):
✅ Allow from public subnets (rules 100-101)
✅ Allow from private subnets (rules 200-201) 
✅ Allow ephemeral ports for return traffic (rule 300)
✅ Allow HTTPS return traffic (rule 310)
✅ Allow HTTP return traffic (rule 320)

OUTBOUND (7 rule types):
✅ Allow to public subnets (rules 100-101)
✅ Allow to private subnets (rules 200-201)
✅ Allow HTTPS for updates/SSM (rule 300)
✅ Allow HTTP for updates (rule 310)
✅ Allow ephemeral return ports (rule 320)
✅ Allow DNS TCP (rule 330)
✅ Allow DNS UDP (rule 340)
```

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

### **Before NACLs:**
```
Internet → Private Instance ❌ (blocked by routes/SG)
Public Instance → Private Instance ✅ (allowed)
```

### **After NACLs:**
```
Internet → Private Instance ❌ (blocked by NACL + routes/SG)
Public Instance → Private Instance ✅ (allowed)
Random Public Subnet → Private Instance ❌ (blocked by NACL)
```

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`modules/vpc/main.tf`** - Added NACL resources and rules
2. **`modules/vpc/outputs.tf`** - Added NACL ID outputs
3. **`outputs.tf`** - Added network security summary
4. **`NETWORK-SECURITY.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Verify NACL configuration:**
   ```bash
   terraform output network_security_summary
   ```

3. **Test connectivity:**
   - Public → Private (should work)
   - Direct Internet → Private (should fail)

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **NACLs are stateless** - both directions must be explicitly allowed
- **Ephemeral ports** (1024-65535) are allowed for return traffic
- **DNS and updates** still work through NAT Gateway
- **SSM Session Manager** still functions properly
- **No impact** on existing application functionality

The implementation provides **subnet-level isolation** while maintaining all required functionality for your 3-tier architecture.
